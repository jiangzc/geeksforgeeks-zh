			<p>Conversion of Digital Data to Digital Signal involves three techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-electronics-difference-unipolar-polar-bipolar-line-coding-schemes/">Line Coding</a></li>
<li>Block Coding</li>
<li>Scrambling</li>
</ol>
<p>Out of which Line coding is always needed, block coding and scrambling may or may not be needed.</p>
<p><b>Block coding</b> helps in error detection and re-transmission of the signal. It is normally referred to as mB/nB coding as it replaces each m-bit data group with an n-bit data group (where n&gt;m). Thus, its adds extra bits (redundancy bits) which helps in synchronization at receiver’s and sender’s end and also providing some kind of error detecting capability.</p>
<p>It normally involves three steps: division, substitution, and combination. In the division step,a sequence of bits is divided into groups of m-bits. In the substitution step, we substitute an m-bit group for an n-bit group. Finally, the n-bit groups are combined together to form a stream which has more bits than the original bits.</p>
<p>Examples of mB/nB coding:</p>

<p><strong>4B/5B (four binary/five binary ) –</strong><br/>
This coding scheme is used in combination with NRZ-I. The problem with NRZ-I was that it has a synchronization problem for long sequences of zeros. So, to overcome it we substitute the bit stream from 4-bit to 5-bit data group <strong>before encoding it with NRZ-I</strong>. So that it does not have a long stream of zeros. The block-coded stream does not have more than three consecutive zeros (see encoding table).</p>

<p>At the receiver, the NRZ-I encoded digital signal is first decoded into a stream of bits and then decoded again to remove the redundancy bits.</p>
<p><strong>Drawback –</strong> Though  4B/5B encoding solves the problem of synchronization,it increases the signal rate of NRZ-L.Moreover,it does not solve the DC component problem of NRZ-L.</p>
<p><strong>8B/10B (eight binary/ten binary) –</strong><br/>
This encoding is similar to 4B/5B encoding except that a group of 8 bits of data is now substituted by a 10-bit code and it provides greater error detection capability than 4B/5B.<br/>
It is actually a combination of 5B/6B and 3B/4B encoding.The most five significant bits of a 10-bit block is fed into the 5B/6B encoder; the least 3 significant bits is fed into a 3B/4B encoder. The split is done to simplify the mapping table.</p>
<p><img src="../../../imgs/digital-logic/9a5a8569af65c5a327c3ea397090ba9a.jpg" alt="mB/nB"/></p>
<p>A group of 8 bits can have 2^8 different combinations while a group of 10 bits can have 2^10 different combinations. This means that there are 2^10-2^8=768 redundant groups that are not used for 8B/10B encoding and can be used for error detection and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8b/10b_encoding#Running_disparity">disparity</a> check.</p>
<p>Thus, this technique is better than 4B/5B because of better error-checking capability and better synchronization.</p>
