			<p><b>Introduction: </b><br/>
A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data.<br/>
Nowadays, a computer can be used to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. It can also be used to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos. But the evolution of this complex system started around 1946 with the first Generation of Computer and evolving ever since.</p>
<p>There are five generations of computers.</p>
<ol>
<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
<li><b>FIRST GENERATION</b></li></h3>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Introduction:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>1946-1959 is the period of first generation computer.</li>
<li>J.P.Eckert and J.W.Mauchy invented the first successful electronic computer called ENIAC, ENIAC stands for “Electronic Numeric Integrated And Calculator”.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><i><b>Few Examples are:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>ENIAC</li>
<li>EDVAC</li>
<li>UNIVAC</li>
<li>IBM-701</li>
<li>IBM-650</li>
<p>…
</p>
</ol>
</li>
<li><i><b>Advantages:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>It made use of vacuum tubes which are the only electronic component available during those days.
</li>
<li>These computers could calculate in milliseconds.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><i><b>Disadvantages:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>These were very big in size, weight was about 30 tones.</li>
<li>These computers were based on vacuum tubes.</li>
<li>These computers were very costly.</li>
<li>It could store only a small amount of information due to the presence of magnetic drums.</li>
<li>As the invention of first generation computers involves vacuum tubes, so another disadvantage of these computers was, vacuum tubes require a large cooling system.</li>
<li>Very less work efficiency.   </li>
<li>Limited programming capabilities and punch cards were used to take inputs.</li>
<li>Large amount of energy consumption.</li>
<li>Not reliable and constant maintenance is required.</li>
</ol>
</li>

</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
<li><b>SECOND GENERATION </b></li></h3>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Introduction:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>1959-1965 is the period of second-generation computer.</li>
<li>3.Second generation computers were based on Transistor instead of vacuum tubes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><i><b>Few Examples are:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>Honeywell 400</li>
<li>IBM 7094</li>
<li>CDC 1604</li>
<li>CDC 3600</li>
<li>UNIVAC 1108</li>
<p>… many more
</p>
</ol>
</li>
<li><i><b>Advantages:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>Due to the presence of transistors instead of vacuum tubes, the size of electron component decreased. This resulted in reducing the size of a computer as compared to first generation computers.    </li>
<li>Less energy and not produce as much heat as the first genration.</li>
<li>Assembly language and punch cards were used for input.</li>
<li>Low cost than first generation computers.</li>
<li>Better speed, calculate data in microseconds.</li>
<li>Better portability as compared to first generation</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><i><b>Disadvantages:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>A cooling system was required.</li>
<li>Constant maintenance was required.</li>
<li>Only used for specific purposes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p><br/></p>
<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
<li><b>THIRD GENERATION </b></li></h3>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Introduction:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>1965-1971 is the period of third generation computer.</li>
<li>These computers were based on Integrated circuits.</li>
<li>IC was invented by Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby In 1958-1959.</li>
<li>IC was a single component containing number of transistors.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><i><b>Few Examples are:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>PDP-8</li>
<li>PDP-11</li>
<li>ICL 2900</li>
<li>IBM 360</li>
<li>IBM 370</li>
<p>… and many more
</p>
</ol>
</li>
<li><i><b>Advantages:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>These computers were cheaper as compared to second-generation computers.</li>
<li>They were fast and reliable.</li>
<li>Use of IC in the computer provides the small size of the computer.</li>
<li>IC not only reduce the size of the computer but it also improves the performance of the computer as compared to previous computers.</li>
<li>This generation of computers has big storage capacity.</li>
<li>Instead of punch cards, mouse and keyboard are used for input.</li>
<li>They used an operating system for better resource management and used the concept of time-sharing and multiple programming.</li>
<li>These computers reduce the computational time from microseconds to nanoseconds.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><i><b>Disadvantages:</b></i>
<ol>
<li>IC chips are difficult to maintain.</li>
<li>The highly sophisticated technology required for the manufacturing of IC chips.</li>
<li>Air conditioning is required.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
