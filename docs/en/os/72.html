A <strong>multitasking operating system</strong> is an operating system that gives you the perception of 2 or more tasks/jobs/processes running at the same time. It does this by dividing system resources amongst these tasks/jobs/processes and switching between the tasks/jobs/processes while they are executing over and over again. Usually CPU processes only one task at a time but the switching is so fast that it looks like CPU is executing multiple processes at a time. They can support either <b>preemptive</b> multitasking, where the OS doles out time to applications (virtually all modern OSes) or <b>cooperative</b> multitasking, where the OS waits for the program to give back control (Windows 3.x, Mac OS 9 and earlier), leading to hangs and crashes. Also known as <strong>Timesharing</strong>, multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking programming is of two types –</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Process-based Multitasking </li>
<li>Thread-based Multitasking.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Process Based Multitasking Programming –</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In process based multitasking two or more processes and programs can be run concurrently.</li>
<li>In process based multitasking a process or a program is the smallest unit.</li>
<li>Program is a bigger unit.</li>
<li>Process based multitasking requires more overhead.</li>
<li>Process requires its own address space.</li>
<li>Process to Process communication is expensive.</li>
<li>Here, it is unable to gain access over idle time of CPU.</li>
<li>It is comparatively heavy weight.</li>
<li>It has slower data rate multi-tasking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example –</strong> We can listen to music and browse internet at the same time. The processes in this example are the music player and browser.</p>
<p><strong>Thread Based Multitasking Programming –</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In thread based multitasking two or more threads can be run concurrently.</li>
<li>In thread based multitasking a thread is the smallest unit.</li>
<li>Thread is a smaller unit.</li>
<li>Thread based multitasking requires less overhead.</li>
<li>Threads share same address space.</li>
<li>Thread to Thread communication is not expensive.</li>
<li>It allows taking gain access over idle time taken by CPU.</li>
<li>It is comparatively light weight.</li>
<li>It has faster data rate multi-tasking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples –</strong> Using a browser we can navigate through the webpage and at the same time download a file. In this example, navigation is one thread and downloading is another thread. Also in a word-processing application like MS Word, we can type text in one thread and spell checker checks for mistakes in another thread.</p>
