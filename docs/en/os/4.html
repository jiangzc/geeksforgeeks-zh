			<p>Real time system means that the system is subjected to real time, i.e., response should be guaranteed within a specified timing constraint or system should meet the specified deadline. For example: flight control system, real time monitors etc. </p>
<p>Types of real time systems based on timing constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Hard real time system –</b><br/>
This type of sytem can never miss its deadline. Missing the deadline may have disastrous consequences.The usefulness of result produced by a hard real time system decreases abruptly and may become negative if tardiness increases. Tardiness means how late a real time system completes its task with respect to its deadline. Example: Flight controller system.<p></p>
</li>
<li><b>Soft real time system –</b><br/>
This type of system can miss its deadline occasionally with some acceptably low probability. Missing the deadline have no disastrous consequences. The usefulness of result produced by a soft real time system decreases gradually with increase in tardiness. Example: Telephone switches.
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Reference model of real time system:</b> Our reference model is characterized by three elements:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>A workload model:</b> It specifies the application supported by system.
</li>
<li><b>A resource model:</b> It specifies the resources available to the application.
</li>
<li><b>Algorithms:</b> It specifies how the application system will use resources.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Terms related to real time system:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Job –</b> A job is a small piece of work that can be assigned to a processor and may or may not require resources.
</li>
<li><b>Task –</b> A set of related jobs that jointly provide some system functionality.
</li>
<li><b>Release time of a job –</b> It is the time at which job becomes ready for execution.
</li>
<li><b>Execution time of a job –</b> It is the time taken by  job to finish its execution.
</li>
<li><b>Deadline of a job –</b> It is the time by which a job should finish its execution. Deadline is of two types: absolute deadline and relative deadline.
</li>
<li><b>Response time of a job –</b> It is the length of time from release time of a job to the instant when it finishes.
</li>
<li>Maximum allowable response time of a job is called its relative deadline.
</li>
<li>Absolute deadline of a job is equal to its relative deadline plus its release time.
</li>
<li>Processors are also known as active resources. They are essential for execution of a job. A job must have one or more processors in order to execute and proceed towards completion. Example: computer, transmission links.
</li>
<li>Resources are also known as passive resources. A job may or may not require a resource during its execution. Example: memory, mutex
</li>
<li>Two resources are identical if they can be used interchangeably else they are heterogeneous.
</li>
</ul>
