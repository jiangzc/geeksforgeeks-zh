			<p>In operating system, following are four common memory management techniques.<span id="more-142469"></span></p>
<pre><strong>Single contiguous allocation:</strong>  Simplest allocation method used by MS-DOS.  
                All memory (except some reserved for OS) is available to 
                a process.

<strong>Partitioned allocation:</strong> Memory is divided in different blocks

<strong>Paged memory management:</strong> Memory is divided in fixed sized units called 
                page frames, used in virtual memory environment.

<strong>Segmented memory management:</strong> Memory is divided in different segments (a 
                segment is logical grouping of process' data or code)
                In this management, allocated memory does'nt  have to 
                be contiguous.</pre>
<p>Most of the operating systems (for example Windows and Linux) use Segmentation with Paging.  A process is divided in segments and individual segments have pages.  </p>
<p>In <strong>Partition Allocation</strong>, when there are more than one partition freely available to accommodate a process’s request, a partition must be selected.  To choose a particular partition, a partition allocation method is needed. A partition allocation method is considered better if it avoids internal fragmentation.</p>
<p>Below are the various partition allocation schemes :</p>
<pre><strong>1. First Fit</strong>: In the first fit, partition is allocated which is first
    sufficient from the top of Main Memory.

<strong>2. Best Fit </strong> Allocate the process to the partition which is first 
    smallest sufficient partition among the free available partition.

<strong>3. Worst Fit </strong> Allocate the process to the partition which is largest
    sufficient among the freely available partitions available in
    the main memory. 

<strong>4. Next Fit</strong> Next fit is similar to the first fit but it will search
    for the first sufficient partition from the last allocation point.</pre>
<p><strong>Is Best-Fit really best?</strong><br/>
Although, best fit  minimizes the wastage space, it consumes a lot of processor time for searching the block which is close to required size.  Also, Best-fit may perform poorer than other algorithms in some cases.  For example, see below exercise.</p>
<br/>
        
          <!-- post_top_responsive -->
          <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-9465609616171866" data-ad-slot="4501693235" data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
          
        <br/>
            
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Exercise: </strong>Consider the requests from processes in given order 300K, 25K, 125K and 50K. Let there be two blocks of memory available of size 150K followed by a block size 350K.<br/>
Which of the following partition allocation schemes can satisfy above requests?<br/>
A) Best fit but not first fit.<br/>
B) First fit but not best fit.<br/>
C) Both First fit &amp; Best fit.<br/>
D) neither first fit nor best fit.</p>
<p>Solution: Let us try all options.<br/>
Best Fit:<br/>
300K is allocated from block of size 350K.  50 is left in the block.<br/>
25K is allocated from the remaining 50K block.  25K is left in the block.<br/>
125K is allocated from 150 K block. 25K is left in this block also.<br/>
50K can’t be allocated even if there is 25K + 25K space available.</p>
<p>First Fit:<br/>
300K request is allocated from 350K block, 50K is left out.<br/>
25K is be allocated from 150K block, 125K is  left out.<br/>
Then 125K and 50K are allocated to remaining left out partitions.<br/>
So, first fit can handle requests.</p>
<p>So option B is the correct choice.</p>
