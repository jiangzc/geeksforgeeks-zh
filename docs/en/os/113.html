			<p>The <strong>crontab</strong> is a list of commands that you want to run on a regular schedule, and also the name of the command used to manage that list. Crontab stands for “cron table, ” because it uses the job scheduler <em>cron</em> to execute tasks; <em>cron</em> itself is named after “chronos, ” the Greek word for time.<em>cron</em> is the system process which will automatically perform tasks for you according to a set schedule. The schedule is called the crontab, which is also the name of the program used to edit that schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Examples of Cron jobs</strong><br/>
<strong>1. Scheduling a Job For a Specific Time</strong></p>
<p>The basic usage of cron is to execute a job in a specific time as shown below. This will execute the Full backup shell script (full-backup) on 10th June 08:30 AM.</p>
<br/>
        
          <!-- post_top_responsive -->
          <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-9465609616171866" data-ad-slot="4501693235" data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
          
        <br/>
            
<p>The time field uses 24 hours format. So, for 8 AM use 8, and for 8 PM use 20.</p>
<pre>30 08 10 06 * /home/maverick/full-backup
</pre>
<p>30 – 30th Minute<br/>
08 – 08 AM<br/>
10 – 10th Day<br/>
06 – 6th Month (June)<br/>
* – Every day of the week</p>
<p><strong>2.To view the Crontab entries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>View Current Logged-In User’s Crontab entries : To view your crontab entries type crontab -l from your unix account.<br/>

<li>View Root Crontab entries : Login as root user (su – root) and do crontab -l.

<li>To view crontab entries of other Linux users : Login to root and use -u {username} -l.<br/>
<img src="../../../imgs/os/782e1b30005ec044dec3c14ff54008fa.jpg" alt="" width="736" height="437" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-188586"/></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.To edit Crontab Entries</strong><br/>
Edit Current Logged-In User’s Crontab entries.To edit a crontab entries, use crontab -e. By default this will edit the current logged-in users crontab.<br/>
<img src="../../../imgs/os/d94f18132e947e270c30ecd836d1a2b7.jpg" alt="" width="736" height="435" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-188591"/><br/>
<strong>4.To schedule a job for every minute using Cron.</strong><br/>
Ideally you may not have a requirement to schedule a job every minute. But understanding this example will will help you understand the other examples.</p>
<pre>* * * * * CMD
</pre>
<p>The * means all the possible unit — i.e every minute of every hour through out the year. More than using this * directly, you will find it very useful in the following cases.</p>
<p>When you specify */5 in minute field means every 5 minutes.<br/>
When you specify 0-10/2 in minute field mean every 2 minutes in the first 10 minute.<br/>
Thus the above convention can be used for all the other 4 fields.<br/>
<strong>5.To schedule a job for more than one time (e.g. Twice a Day)</strong></p>
<p>The following script take a incremental backup twice a day every day.</p>
<p>This example executes the specified incremental backup shell script (incremental-backup) at 11:00 and 16:00 on every day. The comma separated value in a field specifies that the command needs to be executed in all the mentioned time.</p>
<pre>00 11, 16 * * * /home/maverick/bin/incremental-backup
</pre>
<p>00 – 0th Minute (Top of the hour)<br/>
11, 16 – 11 AM and 4 PM<br/>
* – Every day<br/>
* – Every month<br/>
* – Every day of the week</p>
<p><strong>6.To schedule a job for certain range of time (e.g. Only on Weekdays)</strong></p>
<p>If you wanted a job to be scheduled for every hour with in a specific range of time then use the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cron Job everyday during working hours :<br/>
This example checks the status of the database everyday (including weekends) during the working hours 9 a.m – 6 p.m<p></p>
<pre>00 09-18 * * * /home/maverick/bin/check-db-status
</pre>
<p>00 – 0th Minute (Top of the hour)<br/>
09-18 – 9 am, 10 am, 11 am, 12 am, 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, 5 pm, 6 pm<br/>
* – Every day<br/>
* – Every month<br/>
* – Every day of the week</p></li>
<li>Cron Job every weekday during working hours :<br/>
This example checks the status of the database every weekday (i.e excluding Sat and Sun) during the working hours 9 a.m – 6 p.m.<p></p>
<pre>00 09-18 * * 1-5 /home/maverick/bin/check-db-status
</pre>
<p>00 – 0th Minute (Top of the hour)<br/>
09-18 – 9 am, 10 am, 11 am, 12 am, 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, 5 pm, 6 pm<br/>
* – Every day<br/>
* – Every month<br/>
1-5 -Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu and Fri (Every Weekday)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7.To schedule a background Cron job for every 10 minutes.</strong><br/>
Use the following, if you want to check the disk space every 10 minutes.</p>
<pre>*/10 * * * * /home/maverick/check-disk-space
</pre>
<p>It executes the specified command check-disk-space every 10 minutes through out the year. But you may have a requirement of executing the command only during certain hours or vice versa. The above examples shows how to do those things.Instead of specifying values in the 5 fields, we can specify it using a single keyword as mentioned below.</p>
<p>There are special cases in which instead of the above 5 fields you can use @ followed by a keyword — such as reboot, midnight, yearly, hourly.</p>
<p><strong>Cron special keywords and its meaning</strong></p>
<pre>Keyword    Equivalent
@yearly    0 0 1 1 *
@daily     0 0 * * *
@hourly    0 * * * *
@reboot    Run at startup.
</pre>
<p><strong>8.To schedule a job for first minute of every year using @yearly</strong><br/>
If you want a job to be executed on the first minute of every year, then you can use the @yearly cron keyword as shown below.This will execute the system annual maintenance using annual-maintenance shell script at 00:00 on Jan 1st for every year.</p>
<pre>@yearly /home/maverick/bin/annual-maintenance
</pre>
<p><strong>9.To schedule a Cron job beginning of every month using @monthly</strong><br/>
It is as similar as the @yearly as above. But executes the command monthly once using @monthly cron keyword.This will execute the shell script tape-backup at 00:00 on 1st of every month.</p>
<pre>@monthly /home/maverick/bin/tape-backup
</pre>
<p><strong>10.To schedule a background job every day using @daily</strong><br/>
Using the @daily cron keyword, this will do a daily log file cleanup using cleanup-logs shell script at 00:00 on every day.</p>
<pre>@daily /home/maverick/bin/cleanup-logs "day started"
</pre>
<p><strong>11.To execute a linux command after every reboot using @reboot</strong><br/>
Using the @reboot cron keyword, this will execute the specified command once after the machine got booted every time.</p>
<pre>@reboot CMD
</pre>
