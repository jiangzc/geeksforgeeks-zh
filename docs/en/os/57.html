			<p>Prerequisite – <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/process-synchronization-set-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Process Synchronization</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monitors/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Monitors</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/readers-writers-problem-set-1-introduction-and-readers-preference-solution/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Readers-Writers Problem</a><br/>
Considering a shared Database our objectives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Readers can access database only when there are no writers.</li>
<li>Writers can access database only when there are no readers or writers.</li>
<li>Only one thread can manipulate the state variables at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basic structure of a solution –</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Reader()</strong>
   Wait until no writers
   Access database
   Check out – wake up a waiting writer
<strong>Writer()</strong>
   Wait until no active readers or writers
   Access database
   Check out – wake up waiting readers or writer
</pre>
<p>–Now let’s suppose that a writer is active and a mixture of readers and writers now show up.<br/>
<strong>Who should get in next?</strong><br/>
–Or suppose that a writer is waiting and an endless of stream of readers keep showing up.<br/>
<strong>Would it be fair for them to become active?</strong><br/>
So we’ll implement a kind of back-and-forth form of fairness:<br/>
<strong>
</strong></p>
<ul><strong>
<li>Once a reader is waiting, readers will get in next.</li>
<li>If a writer is waiting, one writer will get in next.</li>
</strong></ul>
<strong>
<p></p></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Implementation of the solution using monitors:-</em></strong><p></p>
<ol>
<li>The methods should be executed with mutual exclusion i.e. At each point in time, at most one thread may be executing any of its methods.</li>
<li>Monitors also provide a mechanism for threads to temporarily give up exclusive access, in order to wait for some condition to be met, before regaining exclusive access and resuming their task.</li>
<li>Monitors also have a mechanism for signaling other threads that such conditions have been met.</li>
<li>So in this implementation only mutual exclusion is not enough. Threads attempting an operation may need to wait until some assertion P holds true.</li>
<li>While a thread is waiting upon a condition variable, that thread is not considered to occupy the monitor, and so other threads may enter the monitor to change the monitor’s state.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em><u>Understanding the solution:-</u></em></strong></p>
<ul>
    <strong>
<li>It wants to be fair.</li>
<p></p></strong><p></p>
<ol>
<li>If a writer is waiting, readers queue up.</li>
<li>If a reader (or another writer) is active or waiting, writers queue up.</li>
<li>This is mostly fair, although once it lets a reader in, it lets ALL waiting readers in all at once, even if some showed up “after” other waiting writers.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong></strong><br/>
    <strong>
</strong></p>
<li><strong>The code is “simplified” because we know there can only be one writer at a time.</strong></li>
<strong>
<p></p></strong><br/>
    <strong>
<li>It also takes advantage of the fact that signal is a no-op if nobody is waiting.</li>
<p></p></strong><p></p>
<ol>
<li>In the “EndWrite” code (it signals CanWrite without checking for waiting writers)</li>
<li>In the EndRead code (same thing)</li>
<li>In StartRead (signals CanRead at the end)</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>With Semaphores we never did have a “fair” solution of this sort. In fact it can be done but the code is quite tricky. Here the straightforward solution works in the desired way! Monitors are less error-prone and also easier to understand.</p>
