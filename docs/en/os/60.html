			<p style="text-align: justify">Both of these concepts come under Priority scheduling in Operating System. But are they same ?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In one line, <em>Priority Inversion</em> is a <strong>problem</strong> while <em>Priority Inheritance</em> is a <strong>solution</strong>. Literally, <em>Priority Inversion</em> means that priority of tasks get inverted and <em>Priority Inheritance</em> means that priority of tasks get inherited. Both of these phenomena happen in priority scheduling. Basically, in <em>Priority Inversion</em>, higher priority task (H) ends up waiting for middle priority task (M) when H&#160;is sharing critical section with lower priority task (L) and L is already in critical section. Effectively, H waiting for M results in inverted priority i.e. Priority Inversion. One of the solution for this problem is <em>Priority Inheritance</em>. In <em>Priority Inheritance</em>, when L is in critical section, L inherits priority of H at the time when H starts pending for critical section. By doing so, M doesnâ€™t interrupt L and H doesnâ€™t wait for M to finish. Please note that inheriting of priority is done temporarily i.e. L goes back to its old priority when L comes out of critical section.</p>
