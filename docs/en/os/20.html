			<p>There are three types of process scheduler.</p>
<p><strong>1. Long Term or job scheduler</strong> It bring the new process to the ‘Ready State’.  It controls <em><strong>Degree of Multi-programming</strong></em>, i.e., number of process present in ready state at any point of time. </p>
<p><strong>2. Short term or CPU scheduler:</strong> It is responsible for selecting one process from ready state for scheduling it on the running state. Note: Short term scheduler only selects the process to schedule it doesn’t load the process on running.<br/>
<em><strong>Dispatcher</strong></em> is responsible for loading the selected process by Short Term scheduler on the CPU (Ready to Running State) Context switching is done by dispatcher only. A dispatcher does following:<br/>
1)    Switching context.<br/>
2)    Switching to user mode.<br/>
3)    Jumping to the proper location in the newly loaded program.</p>
<p><strong>3. Medium term scheduler</strong> It is responsible for suspending and resuming the process. It mainly does swapping (moving processes from main memory to disk and vice versa).</p>
