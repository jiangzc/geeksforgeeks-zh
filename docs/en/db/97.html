			<p>Following questions have been asked in GATE CS 2005 exam.<span id="more-20761"></span></p>
<p><strong>1) Let r be a relation instance with schema R = (A, B, C, D). We define r1 = ‘select A,B,C from r’ and r2 = ‘select A, D from r’. Let s = r1 * r2 where * denotes natural join. Given that the decomposition of r into r1 and r2 is lossy, which one of the following is TRUE?</strong><br/>
(a) s is subset of r<br/>
(b) r U s = r<br/>
(c) r is a subset of s<br/>
(d) r * s = s</p>
<p>Answer (c)<br/>
Consider the following example with lossy decomposition of r into r1 and r2.  We can see that r is a subset of s.</p>
<pre>Table r
 A      B      C      D
---------------------------
 1     10     100    1000    
 1     20     200    1000    
 1     20     200    1001 

Table r1
 A      B      C
------------------
 1     10     100 
 1     20     200 

Table r2
 A     D  
-----------
 1    1000  
 1    1001

Table s (natural join of r1 and r2)
 A      B      C      D
---------------------------
 1     10     100    1000    
 1     20     200    1000    
 1     10     100    1001 
 1     20     200    1001 

</pre>

<strong>2) Let E1 and E2 be two entities in an E/R diagram with simple single-valued attributes. R1 and R2 are two relationships between E1 and E2, where R1 is one-to-many and R2 is many-to-many. R1 and R2 do not have any attributes of their own. What is the minimum number of tables required to represent this situation in the relational model?</strong><br/>
(a) 2<br/>
(b) 3<br/>
(c) 4<br/>
(d) 5</p>
<p>Answer (b)<br/>

<strong>3) Consider a relation scheme R = (A, B, C, D, E, H) on which the following functional dependencies hold: {A–&gt;�B, BC–&gt;� D, E–&gt;C, D–&gt;A}. What are the candidate keys of R?</strong><br/>
(a) AE, BE<br/>
(b) AE, BE, DE<br/>
(c) AEH, BEH, BCH<br/>
(d) AEH, BEH, DEH</p>
<p>Answer (d)<br/>
A set of attributes S is candidate key of relation R if the closure of S is all attributes of R and there is no subset of S whose closure is all attributes of R.<br/>
Closure of AEH, i.e. AEH+  = {ABCDEH}<br/>
Closure of BEH, i.e. BEH+  = {ABCDEH}<br/>
Closure of DEH, i.e. DEH+  = {ABCDEH}</p>
