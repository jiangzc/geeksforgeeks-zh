			<p><b>Prerequisite –</b> <a href="http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/database-normalization-introduction/">Database normalization and functional dependency concept</a>.</p>
<p><b>Normalization</b> is the process of minimizing <b>redundancy</b> from a relation or set of relations. Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion and updation anomalies. So, it helps to minimize the redundancy in relations. <b>Normal forms</b> are used to eliminate or reduce redundancy in database tables.</p>
<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">1. First Normal Form –</h3>
<p>If a relation contain composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates first normal form or a relation is in first normal form if it does not contain any composite or multi-valued attribute.  A relation is in first normal form if every attribute in that relation is <b>singled valued attribute</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Example 1 –</b> Relation STUDENT in table 1 is not in 1NF because of multi-valued attribute STUD_PHONE. Its decomposition into 1NF has been shown in table 2.<br/>

<li><b>Example 2 –</b>
<pre> 
ID   Name   Courses
------------------
1    A      c1, c2
2    E      c3
3    M      C2, c3
</pre>
<p>In the above table Course is a multi valued attribute so it is not in 1NF.</p>
<p>Below Table is in 1NF as there is no multi valued attribute</p><br/>

<pre>ID   Name   Course
------------------
1    A       c1
1    A       c2
2    E       c3
3    M       c1
3    M       c2</pre>
<p>&#160;
</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">2. Second Normal Form –</h3>
<p>To be in second normal form, a relation must be in first normal form and relation must not contain any partial dependency. A relation is in 2NF iff it has <strong>No Partial Dependency, </strong>i.e.<strong>, </strong>no non-prime attribute (attributes which are not part of any candidate key) is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the table. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Normalisation_normalforms_2.png"><img src="../../../imgs/db/bd92f113b1b188b9d343f3437d3946f8.jpg" alt="image4" width="546" height="141" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-151210"/></a></p>
<p><b>Partial Dependency –</b> If proper subset of candidate key determines non-prime attribute, it is called partial dependency. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Example 1 –</b> In relation STUDENT_COURSE given in Table 3,
<pre>FD set: {COURSE_NO-&gt;COURSE_NAME}
Candidate Key: {STUD_NO, COURSE_NO}
</pre>
<p>In FD COURSE_NO-&gt;COURSE_NAME, COURSE_NO (proper subset of candidate key) is determining COURSE_NAME (non-prime attribute). Hence, it is partial dependency and relation is not in second normal form.<br/>
To convert it to second normal form, we will decompose the relation STUDENT_COURSE (STUD_NO, COURSE_NO, COURSE_NAME) as :</p>
<pre>STUDENT_COURSE (STUD_NO, COURSE_NO)
COURSE (COURSE_NO, COURSE_NAME)
</pre>
<p>Note – This decomposition will be lossless join decomposition as well as dependency preserving.</p></li>
<li><b>Example 2 –</b> Consider following functional dependencies in relation&#160; R (A,&#160; B , C,&#160; D )
<pre>AB -&gt; C  [A and B together determine C]
BC -&gt; D  [B and C together determine D]</pre>
<p>In the above relation, AB is the only candidate key and there is no partial dependency, i.e., any proper subset of AB doesn’t determine any non-prime attribute.</p></li>
<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">3. Third Normal Form –</h3>
<p>A relation is in third normal form, if there is <b>no transitive dependency</b> for non-prime attributes is it is in second normal form.<br/>
A relation is in 3NF iff <strong>at least one of the following condition holds</strong> in every non-trivial function dependency X –&gt; Y</p>
<ol>
<li>X is a super key.</li>
<li>Y is a prime attribute (each element of Y is part of some candidate key).</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Normalisation_normalforms_3.png"><img src="../../../imgs/db/ba582802f844ab4505b50765b880d1ad.jpg" alt="image5" width="717" height="159" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-151212"/></a><br/>
<strong> Transitive dependency – </strong> If A-&gt;B and B-&gt;C are two FDs then A-&gt;C is called transitive dependency. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Example 1 –</b> In relation STUDENT given in Table 4,
<p>FD set: {STUD_NO -&gt; STUD_NAME, STUD_NO -&gt; STUD_STATE, STUD_NO -&gt; STUD_COUNTRY, STUD_NO -&gt; STUD_AGE, STUD_STATE -&gt; STUD_COUNTRY}<br/>
Candidate Key: {STUD_NO} </p>
<p>For this relation in table 4, STUD_NO -&gt; STUD_STATE and STUD_STATE -&gt; STUD_COUNTRY are true. So STUD_COUNTRY is transitively dependent on STUD_NO. It violates third normal form. To convert it in third normal form, we will decompose the relation STUDENT (STUD_NO, STUD_NAME, STUD_PHONE, STUD_STATE, STUD_COUNTRY_STUD_AGE) as:<br/>
STUDENT (STUD_NO, STUD_NAME, STUD_PHONE, STUD_STATE, STUD_AGE)<br/>
STATE_COUNTRY (STATE, COUNTRY)</p></li>
<li><b>Example 2 –</b> Consider relation R(A, B, C, D, E)<br/>
  A -&gt; BC,<br/>
  CD -&gt; E,<br/>
  B -&gt; D,<br/>
  E -&gt; A<br/>
All possible candidate keys in above relation are {A, E, CD, BC} All attribute are on right sides of all functional dependencies are prime.</li>
<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) –</h3>
<p>A relation R is in BCNF if R is in Third Normal Form and for every FD, LHS is super key. A relation is in BCNF iff in every non-trivial functional dependency X –&gt; Y, X is a super key.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Example 1 –</b> Find the highest normal form of a relation R(A,B,C,D,E) with FD set as {BC-&gt;D, AC-&gt;BE, B-&gt;E}<br/>
Step 1. As we can see, (AC)+ ={A,C,B,E,D} but none of its subset can determine all attribute of relation, So AC will be candidate key. A or C can’t be derived from any other attribute of the relation, so there will be only 1 candidate key {AC}.<br/>
Step 2. Prime attribute are those attribute which are part of candidate key {A,C} in this example and others will be non-prime {B,D,E} in this example.<br/>
Step 3. The relation R is in 1st normal form as a relational DBMS does not allow multi-valued or composite attribute.<br/>
The relation is in 2nd normal form because BC-&gt;D is in 2nd normal form (BC is not proper subset of candidate key AC) and AC-&gt;BE is in 2nd normal form (AC is candidate key) and B-&gt;E is in 2nd normal form (B is not a proper subset of candidate key AC).<br/>
The relation is not in 3rd normal form because in BC-&gt;D (neither BC is a super key nor D is a prime attribute) and in B-&gt;E (neither B is a super key nor E is a prime attribute) but to satisfy 3rd normal for, either LHS of an FD should be super key or RHS should be prime attribute.<br/>
So the highest normal form of relation will be 2nd Normal form.</li>
<li><b>Example 2 –</b>For example consider relation R(A, B, C)<br/>
  A -&gt; BC,<br/>
  B -&gt;<br/>
A and B both are super keys so above relation is in BCNF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Points –</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li> BCNF is free from redundancy.</li>
<li> If a relation is in BCNF, then 3NF is also also satisfied.</li>
<li>&#160;If all attributes of relation are prime attribute, then the relation is always in 3NF.</li>
<li> A relation in a Relational Database is always and at least in 1NF form.</li>
<li>Every Binary Relation ( a Relation with only 2 attributes ) is always in BCNF.</li>
<li>If a Relation has only singleton candidate keys( i.e. every candidate key consists of only 1 attribute), then the Relation is always in 2NF( because no Partial functional dependency possible).</li>
<li> Sometimes going for BCNF form may not preserve functional dependency. In that case go for BCNF only if the lost FD(s) is not required, else normalize till 3NF only.</li>
<li>There are many more Normal forms that exist after BCNF, like 4NF and more. But in real world database systems it’s generally not required to go beyond BCNF.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>: Find the highest normal form in R (A, B, C, D, E) under following functional dependencies.
</p>
<pre>  ABC --&gt; D
  CD --&gt; AE </pre>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Important Points</strong> for solving above type of question.<br/>
<strong>1)</strong> It is always a good idea to start checking from BCNF, then 3 NF and so on.<br/>
<strong>2) </strong>If any functional dependency satisfied a normal form then there is no need to check for lower normal form. For example, ABC –&gt; D is in BCNF (Note that ABC is a super key), so no need to check this dependency for lower normal forms.</p>
<p>Candidate keys in given relation are {ABC, BCD}</p>
<p><strong>BCNF:</strong> ABC -&gt; D is in BCNF. Let us check CD -&gt; AE, CD is not a super key so this dependency is not in BCNF. So, R is not in BCNF.</p>
<p><strong>3NF:</strong> ABC -&gt; D we don’t need to check for this dependency as it already satisfied BCNF. Let us consider CD -&gt; AE. Since E is not a prime attribute, so relation is not in 3NF.</p>
<p><strong>2NF: </strong> In 2NF, we need to check for partial dependency. CD which is a proper subset of a candidate key and it determine E, which is non prime attribute. So, given relation is also not in 2 NF. So, the highest normal form is 1 NF.</p>
