<p align="center"> <strong> Terminology </strong> </p>
<p><strong>Relational Model: </strong> Relational model represents data in the form of relations or tables.</p>
<p><strong>Relational Schema:</strong> Schema represents structure of a relation. e.g.; Relational Schema of STUDENT relation can be represented as:<br/>
STUDENT (STUD_NO, STUD_NAME, STUD_PHONE, STUD_STATE, STUD_COUNTRY, STUD_AGE)</p>
<p><strong>Relational Instance:</strong> The set of values present in a relation at a particular instance of time is known as relational instance as shown in Table 1 and Table 2.</p>
<br/>

        <br/>
            
<p><strong>Attribute:</strong> Each relation is defined in terms of some properties, each of which is known as attribute. For Example, STUD_NO, STUD_NAME etc. are attributes of relation STUDENT. </p>
<p><strong>Domain of an attribute: </strong>The possible values an attribute can take in a relation is called its domain. For Example, domain of STUD_AGE can be from 18 to 40.<br/>
<strong>Tuple:</strong> Each row of a relation is known as tuple. e.g.; STUDENT relation given above has 4 tuples.</p>
<p><strong>NULL values:</strong> Values of some attribute for some tuples may be unknown, missing or undefined which are represented by NULL. Two NULL values in a relation are considered different from each other.<br/>
Table 1 and Table 2 represent relational model having two relations STUDENT and STUDENT_COURSE.  </p>

<p align="center"><strong>Codd Rules</strong> </p>
<p>Codd rules were proposed by E.F. Codd which should be satisfied by relational model. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Information Rule:</strong> Data stored in Relational model must be a value of some cell of a table.</li>
<li><strong>Guaranteed Access Rule:</strong> Every data element must be accessible by table name, its primary key and name of attribute whose value is to be determined. </li>
<li><strong>Systematic Treatment of NULL values:</strong> NULL value in database must only correspond to missing, unknown or not applicable values.</li>
<li><strong>Active Online Catalog:</strong> Structure of database must be stored in an online catalog which can be queried by authorized users.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Data Sub-language Rule:</strong> A database should be accessible by a language supported for definition, manipulation and transaction management operation.</li>
<li><strong>View Updating Rule:</strong> Different views created for various purposes should be automatically updatable by the system.</li>
<li><strong>High level insert, update and delete rule:</strong> Relational Model should support insert, delete, update etc. operations at each level of relations. Also, set operations like Union, Intersection and minus should be supported.</li>
<li><strong>Physical data independence:</strong> Any modification in the physical location of a table should not enforce modification at application level.</li>
<li><strong>Logical data independence:</strong> Any modification in logical or conceptual schema of a table should not enforce modification at application level. For example, merging of two tables into one should not affect application accessing it which is difficult to achieve. </li>
<li><strong>Integrity Independence:</strong> Integrity constraints modified at database level should not enforce modification at application level. </li>
<li><strong>Distribution Independence:</strong> Distribution of data over various locations should not be visible to end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Subversion Rule:</strong> Low level access to data should not be able to bypass integrity rule to change data.</li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><strong>GATE Question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Given the basic ER and relational models, which of the following is INCORRECT?</strong>        [GATE CS 2012]<br/>
A. An attribute of an entity can have more than one value<br/>
B. An attribute of an entity can be composite<br/>
C. In a row of a relational table, an attribute can have more than one value<br/>
D. In a row of a relational table, an attribute can have exactly one value or a NULL value</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> In relation model, an attribute canâ€™t have more than one value. So, option C is the answer.</p>
