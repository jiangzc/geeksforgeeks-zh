<p><strong>Q. There is a table where only one row is fully repeated. Write a Query to find the Repeated row</strong></p>
<table width="500">
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>Name</strong></td>
<td><strong>Section</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>abc</td>
<td>CS1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bcd</td>
<td>CS2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>abc</td>
<td>CS1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the above table, we can find duplicate row using below query.</p>
<pre>SELECT name, section FROM tbl
GROUP BY name, section
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1
</pre>
<p><strong>Q. Query to find 2nd highest salary of an employee?</strong></p>
<pre>SELECT max(salary) FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE salary IN
(SELECT salary FROM EMPLOYEEs MINUS SELECT max(salary)
FROM EMPLOYEES);</pre>
<p>OR
</p>
<pre>SELECT max(salary) FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE 
salary &lt;&gt; (SELECT max(salary) FROM EMPLOYEES);</pre>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q.Consider the following Employee table.&#160;How many rows are there in the result of following query?</strong></p>
<br/>
        
          <!-- post_top_responsive -->
          
          
        <br/>
            
<p><strong>ID&#160;&#160; salary&#160;&#160; DeptName</strong><br/>
1&#160;&#160;&#160; 10000&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; EC<br/>
2&#160;&#160;&#160; 40000&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; EC<br/>
3&#160;&#160;&#160; 30000&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; CS<br/>

7&#160;&#160;&#160; 70000&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; CS</p>
<p><strong>How many rows are there in the result of following query?</strong></p>
<pre>SELECT E.ID
FROM&#160; Employee E
WHERE&#160; EXISTS&#160; (SELECT E2.salary
FROM Employee E2
WHERE E2.DeptName = 'CS'
AND&#160;&#160; E.salary &gt; E2.salary)</pre>
<p>Following 5 rows will&#160;be result of query as 3000 is the minimum salary of CS Employees and all these rows are greater than 30000.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Write a trigger to update Emp table such that, If an updation is done in Dep table then salary of all employees of that department should be incremented by some amount (updation)</strong></p>
<p>Assuming Table name are Dept and Emp, trigger can be written as –</p>
<pre>CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER update_trig
AFTER UPDATE ON Dept
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
CURSOR emp_cur IS SELECT * FROM Emp;
BEGIN
FOR i IN emp_cur LOOP
IF i.dept_no = :NEW.dept_no THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(i.emp_no);&#160; --&#160; for printing those
UPDATE Emp&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; -- emp number which are
SET sal = i.sal + 100&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; -- updated
WHERE emp_no = i.emp_no;
END IF;
END LOOP;
END;</pre>
<p><strong>Q. There is a table which contains two column Student and Marks, you need to find all the students, whose marks are greater than average marks i.e. list of above average students.</strong></p>
<pre>SELECT student, marks 
FROM table
WHERE marks &gt; SELECT AVG(marks) from table;</pre>
<p><strong>Q.Name the student who has secured third highest marks using sub queries.</strong></p>
<pre>SELECT Emp1.Name
FROM Employee Emp1
WHERE 2 = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(Emp2.Salary))
           FROM Employee Emp2
           WHERE Emp2.Salary &gt; Emp1.Salary
          )</pre>
<p>*LOGIC- Number of people with salary higher than this person will be 2.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Why we cannot use WHERE clause with aggregate functions like HAVING ?</strong></p>
<p>The difference between the having and where clause in SQL is that the where clause canNOT&#160;be used with aggregates, but the having clause can. Please note : It is not a predefined rule but by and large you’ll see that in a good number of the SQL queries, we use&#160;WHERE&#160;prior to&#160;GROUP BY&#160;and&#160;HAVING&#160;after&#160;GROUP BY.</p>
<p>The Where clause acts as a pre filter&#160;where as Having as a&#160;post filter.</p>
<p>The where clause works on row’s data, not on aggregated data.</p>
<p>Let us consider below table ‘Marks’.</p>
<p>Student&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Course&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Score</p>
<p>a&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; c1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 40<br/>
a &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; c2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 50<br/>
b &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; c3 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 60<br/>
d &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; c1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 70<br/>
e &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; c2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 80</p>
<p>Consider the query
</p>
<pre>SELECT Student, sum(Score) AS total 
FROM Marks</pre>
<p></p>
<p>This would select data row by row basis. The&#160;having&#160;clause works on aggregated data.</p>
<p>For example,&#160; output of below query
</p>
<pre>SELECT Student, sum(score) AS total FROM Marks</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Student&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Total<br/>
a&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;90<br/>
b &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 60<br/>
d &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 70<br/>
e &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 80</p>
<p>When we apply having in above query, we get
</p>
<pre>SELECT Student, sum(score) AS total
FROM Marks having total &gt; 70</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Student&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Total<br/>
a&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 90<br/>
e             80</p>
<p><strong>Q. Difference between primary key and unique key and why one should use unique key if it allows only one null ?</strong></p>
<p>Primary key:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one in a row(tuple).</li>
<li>Never allows null value(only key field).</li>
<li>Unique key identifier and can not be null and must be unique.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unique Key:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be more than one unique key in one row.</li>
<li>Unique key can have null values(only single null is allowed).</li>
<li>It can be a candidate key.</li>
<li>Unique key can be null and may not be unique.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q. What’s the difference between materialized and dynamic view?</strong></p>
<p>Materialized views</p>
<ul>
<li>Disk based and are updated periodically based upon the query definition.</li>
<li>A materialized table is created or updated infrequently and it must be synchronized with its associated base tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamic views</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual only and run the query definition each time they are accessed.</li>
<li>A dynamic view may be created every time that a specific view is requested by the user.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q. What is embedded and dynamic SQL?&#160;</strong></p>
<p>Static or Embedded SQL</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL statements in an application that do not change at runtime and, therefore, can be hard-coded into the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamic SQL</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL statements that are constructed at runtime; for example, the application may allow users to enter their own queries.</li>
<li>Dynamic SQL is a programming technique that enables you to buildSQL statements dynamically at runtime. You can create more general purpose, flexible applications by using dynamic SQL because the full text of a SQL statement may be unknown at compilation.</li>

<p><strong>Q. What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CHAR and VARCHAR are differ in storage and retrieval.</li>
<li>CHAR column length is fixed while VARCHAR length is variable.</li>
<li>The maximum no. of character CHAR data type can hold is 255 character while VARCHAR can hold up to 4000 character.</li>
<li>CHAR is 50% faster than VARCHAR.</li>
<li>CHAR uses static memory allocation while VARCHAR uses dynamic memory allocation.</li>
