<p>A relationship between two entities of similar entity type is called a <b>recursive</b> relationship. Here the same entity type participates more than once in a relationship type with a different role for each instance. In other words, a relationship has always been between occurrences in two different entities. However, it is possible for the same entity to participate in the relationship. This is termed a <b>recursive</b> relationship.</p>

<p><b>Example –</b><br/>
Let us suppose that we have an employee table. A manager supervises a subordinate. Every employee can have a supervisor except the CEO and there can be at most one boss for each employee. One employee may be the boss of more than one employee. Let’s suppose that REPORTS_TO is a recursive relationship on the Employee entity type where each Employee plays two roles </p>
<ol>
<li> Supervisor</li>
<li> Subordinate </li>
</ol>

        <br/>
            
<p>Supervisor and Subordinate are called <strong>“Role Names”</strong>. Here the degree of the REPORTS_TO relationship is 2 i.e. a binary relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum cardinality of Supervisor entity is ZERO since the lowest level employee may not be a manager for anyone. </li>
<li>The maximum cardinality of Supervisor entity is N since an employee can manage many employees.</li>
<li>Similarly the Subordinate entity has a minimum cardinality of ZERO to account for the case where CEO can never be a subordinate.</li>
<li>It maximum cardinality is ONE since a subordinate employee can have at most one supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note –</strong> Here none of the participants have a total participation since both minimum cardinalities are Zero. Hence, the relationships are connected by a single line instead of a double line in the ER diagram.</p>
<p>To implement recursive relationship, a foreign key of the employee’s manager number would be held in each employee record. A Sample table would look something like this:-</p>
<pre>Emp_entity( Emp_no,Emp_Fname, Emp_Lname, Emp_DOB, Emp_NI_Number, Manager_no);

Manager no - (this is the employee no of the employee's manager)
</pre>
