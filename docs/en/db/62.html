			<p>Two schedules S1 and S2 are said to be view equal iff following below conditions are satisfied :<span id="more-142374"></span></p>
<p><strong>1)<strong> Initial Read </strong></strong><br/>
  If a transaction T1 reading data item A from initial database in S1 then in S2 also T1 should read A from initial database.</p>
<pre>  T1     T2     T3
-------------------
        R(A)
 W(A)          
               R(A)
        R(B)</pre>
<p>Transaction T2 is reading A form initial database.</p>
<p><strong>2)<strong>Updated Read</strong></strong><br/>
  If Ti is reading A which is updated by Tj in S1 then in S2 also Ti should read A which is updated by Tj.</p>
<pre>  T1     T2     T3         T1    T2    T3                   
-------------------       ----------------
  W(A)                    W(A)       
        W(A)                           R(A)
                R(A)             W(A)</pre>
<p>Above two schedule are not view equal as in S1 :T3 is reading A updated by T2, in S2 T3 is reading A updated by T1.</p>

<p><strong>3)<strong>Final Write operation </strong></strong><br/>
  If a transaction T1 updated A at last in S1, then in S2 also T1 should perform final write operations.</p>
<pre> T1       T2        T1     T2            
------------    ---------------
 R(A)              R(A)
         W(A)      W(A)
 W(A)                    W(A)
</pre>
<p>Above two schedule are not view as Final write operation in S1 is done by T1 while in S2 done by T2.</p>
<p><strong>View Serializability: </strong>A Schedule is called view serializable if it is view equal to a serial schedule (no overlapping transactions).</p>
