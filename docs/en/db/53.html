<!-- .entry-header -->
				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Now that we are familiar with what is <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms-concurrency-control-protocols-two-phase-locking-2-pl/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Two Phase Locking (2-PL)</a> and the basic rules which should be followed which ensures serializablity. Moreover we came across the problems with 2-PL, Cascading Aborts and Deadlocks. Now, we turn towards the enhancements made on 2-PL which tries to make the protocol nearly error free. Briefly we allow some modifications to 2-PL to improve it. There are three categories: </p>
<ol>
<li>Strict 2-PL</li>
<li>Rigorous 2-PL</li>
<li>Conservative 2-PL</li>
</ol>
<p>Now recall the rules followed in Basic 2-PL, over that we make some extra modifications. Let’s now see what are the modifications and what drawbacks they solve. </p>
<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Strict 2-PL –</h3>
<p>This requires that in addition to the lock being 2-Phase <strong>all Exclusive(X) Locks</strong> held by the transaction be released until <em>after</em> the Transaction Commits.<br/>
Following Strict 2-PL ensures that our schedule is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Recoverable</li>
<li>Cascadeless</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Hence it gives us freedom from Cascading Abort which was still there in Basic 2-PL and moreover guarantee Strict Schedules but still <em>Deadlocks are possible</em>! </p>
<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Rigorous 2-PL –</h3>
<p>This requires that in addition to the lock being 2-Phase <strong>all Exclusive(X) and Shared(S) Locks</strong> held by the transaction be released until <em>after</em> the Transaction Commits.<br/>
Following Rigorous 2-PL ensures that our schedule is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Recoverable</li>
<li>Cascadeless</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Hence it gives us freedom from Cascading Abort which was still there in Basic 2-PL and moreover guarantee Strict Schedules but still <em>Deadlocks are possible</em>!</p>
<p>Note the difference between Strict 2-PL and Rigorous 2-PL is that Rigorous is more restrictive, it requires both Exclusive and Shared locks to be held until after the Transaction commits and this is what makes the implementation of Rigorous 2-PL more easy.</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Conservative 2-PL –</h3>
<p>A.K.A <strong>Static 2-PL</strong>, this protocol requires the transaction to lock all the items it access before the Transaction begins execution by predeclaring its read-set and write-set. If any of the predeclared items needed cannot be locked, the transaction does not lock any of the items, instead it waits until all the items are available for locking.<br/>
<br/>
Conservative 2-PL is <em>Deadlock free</em> and yes it ensures Cascadeless schedules and moreover it guarantee Strict Schedules. However, it is difficult to use in practice because of need to predeclare the read-set and the write-set which is not possible in many situations. In practice, the most popular variation of 2-PL is Strict 2-PL.<br/>
<br/>
The Venn Diagram below shows the classification of schedules which are rigorous and strict. The universe represents the schedules which can be serialized as 2-PL. Now as the diagram suggests, and it can also be logically concluded, if a schedule is Rigorous then it is Strict. We can also think in another way, say we put a restriction on a schedule which makes it strict, adding another to the list of restrictions make it Rigorous. Take a moment to again analyze the diagram and you’ll definitely get it.</p>

<p>Now, let’s see the schedule below, tell me if this schedule can be locked using 2-PL and if yes, show how and what class of 2-PL does your answer belongs?</p>
<table style="width:50%">
<tbody><tr><th></th>
<th><strong>T<sub>1</sub></strong></th>
<th><strong>T<sub>2</sub></strong></th>

<p>I recommend you to try before looking at the solution.<br/>
Yes, the schedule is conflict serializable so we can try implementing 2-PL. So, let’s try….<br/>

<p>Now, this is one way I choose to implement the locks on A and B. You may try a different sequence but remember to follow the 2-PL protocol. With that said, observe that our locks are released after Commit operation so this satisfies Rigorous 2-PL protocol. </p>
<p>By now, I guess you must’ve got the idea how to differentiate between types of 2-PL. Remember the theory as problems come in the examination sometimes just based on theoretical knowledge. Next we’ll look at some examples on Conservative 2-PL and how does it differs from the above two types of 2-PL. What makes it Deadlock free and also so difficult to implement. Then we’ll conclude the topic of 2-PL. Shortly we’ll move on to another type of Lock based Protocols- Graph Based Protocols. They are also very interesting and provides unique method to deal with the problem of Deadlocks! So we’ll learn a new type of locking protocol, that will conclude the topic of Lock based Protocol for GATE, till then Happy Learning.</p>
