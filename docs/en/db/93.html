			<p>Following questions have been asked in GATE 2009 CS exam.<span id="more-20654"></span></p>
<p><strong>1) Consider two transactions T1 and T2, and four schedules S1, S2, S3, S4 of T1 and T2 as given below:</strong><br/>
T1 = R1[X] W1[X] W1[Y]<br/>
T2 = R2[X] R2[Y] W2[Y]<br/>
S1 = R1[X] R2[X] R2[Y] W1[X] W1[Y] W2[Y]<br/>
S2 = R1[X] R2[X] R2[Y] W1[X] W2[Y] W1[Y]<br/>
S3 = R1[X] W1[X] R2[X] W1[Y] R2[Y] W2[Y]<br/>
S1 = R1[X] R2[Y]R2[X]W1[X] W1[Y] W2[Y]<br/>
<strong>Which of the above schedules are conflict-serializable?</strong><br/>
(A) S1 and S2<br/>
(B) S2 and S3<br/>
(C) S3 only<br/>
(D) S4 only</p>
<p>Answer (B)<br/>
There can be two possible serial schedules T1 T2 and T2 T1.  The serial schedule T1 T2 has the following sequence of operations<br/>
R1[X] W1[X] W1[Y] R2[X] R2[Y] W2[Y]<br/>
And the schedule T2 T1 has the following sequence of operations.<br/>
R2[X] R2[Y] W2[Y] R1[X] W1[X] W1[Y]<br/>
The Schedule S2 is conflict-equivalent to T2 T1 and S3 is conflict-equivalent to T1 T2.</p>

<strong>2) Let R and S be relational schemes such that R={a,b,c} and S={c}. Now consider<br/>
the following queries on the database:</strong><br/>

<pre>IV) SELECT R.a, R.b
       FROM R,S
            WHERE R.c=S.c
</pre>
<p><strong>Which of the above queries are equivalent?</strong><br/>
(A) I and II<br/>
(B) I and III<br/>
(C) II and IV<br/>
(D) III and IV</p>
<br/>
        
          <!-- post_top_responsive -->
          
          
        <br/>
            
<p>Answer (A)<br/>
I and II describe the division operator in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra">Relational Algebra</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple_relational_calculus">Tuple Relational Calculus</a> respectively. See Page 3 of <a href="http://users.abo.fi/soini/divisionEnglish.pdf">this </a> and slide numbers 9,10 of <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs186/fa05/lecs/10CalcSQLI-6up.pdf">this </a>for more details.</p>
<p><br/><br/>
<strong>3) Consider the following relational schema:
</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Suppliers(<u>sid:integer</u>, sname:string, city:string, street:string)
Parts(<u>pid:integer</u>, pname:string, color:string)
Catalog(<u>sid:integer, pid:integer</u>, cost:real)</strong></pre>
<strong>
<p>Consider the following relational query on the above database:</p></strong><p></p>
<pre>SELECT S.sname
    FROM Suppliers S
        WHERE S.sid NOT IN (SELECT C.sid
                            FROM Catalog C
                            WHERE C.pid NOT IN (SELECT P.pid  
                                                FROM Parts P                                                                                                    
                                                WHERE P.color&lt;&gt; 'blue'))
</pre>
<p><strong>Assume that relations corresponding to the above schema are not empty. Which one of the following is the correct interpretation of the above query?<br/>
</strong><br/>
(A) Find the names of all suppliers who have supplied a non-blue part.<br/>
(B) Find the names of all suppliers who have not supplied a non-blue part.<br/>
(C) Find the names of all suppliers who have supplied only blue parts.<br/>
(D) Find the names of all suppliers who have not supplied only blue parts.</p>
<p>Answer (A)<br/>
The subquery “<em>SELECT P.pid FROM Parts P WHERE P.color&lt;&gt; ‘blue’</em>” gives pids of parts which are not blue. The bigger subquery “<em>SELECT C.sid FROM Catalog C WHERE C.pid NOT IN (SELECT P.pid FROM Parts P WHERE P.color&lt;&gt; ‘blue’)</em>” gives sids of all those suppliers who have supplied blue parts.  The complete query gives the names of all suppliers who have supplied a non-blue part</p>
<p><br/><br/>
<strong>4) Assume that, in the suppliers relation above, each supplier and each street within a city has a unique name, and (sname, city) forms a candidate key. No other functional dependencies are implied other than those implied by primary and candidate keys. Which one of the following is TRUE about the above schema?</strong><br/>
(A) The schema is in BCNF<br/>
(B) The schema is in 3NF but not in BCNF<br/>
(C) The schema is in 2NF but not in 3NF<br/>
(D) The schema is not in 2NF</p>
<p>Answer (A)<br/>
A relation is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form" target="_blank">BCNF </a>if for every one of its dependencies X ? Y, at least one of the following conditions hold:
</p>
<pre>    X ? Y is a trivial functional dependency (Y ? X)
    X is a superkey for schema R </pre>
<p></p>
<p>Since  (sname, city) forms a candidate key, there is no non-tirvial dependency X ? Y where X is not a superkey</p>
