			<p>Following questions have been asked in GATE 2008 CS exam.<span id="more-20708"></span></p>
<p><strong>1) Let R and S be two relations with the following schema<br/>
R (<u>P,Q</u>,R1,R2,R3)<br/>
S (<u>P,Q</u>,S1,S2)<br/>
Where {P, Q} is the key for both schemas. Which of the following queries are equivalent?</strong><br/>

(A) Only I and II<br/>
(B) Only I and III<br/>
(C) Only I, II and III<br/>
(D) Only I, III and IV</p>
<p>Answer (D)<br/>
In I, Ps from natural join of R and S are selected.<br/>
In III, all Ps from intersection of (P, Q) pairs present in R and S.<br/>
IV is also equivalent to III because  (R – (R – S)) = R ∩ S.<br/>
II is not equivalent as it may also include Ps where Qs are not same in R and S.</p>
<p><br/><br/>
<strong>2) Consider the following ER diagram.<br/>

<p>The minimum number of tables needed to represent M, N, P, R1, R2 is<br/>
(A) 2<br/>
(B) 3<br/>
(C) 4<br/>
(D) 5</p>
<br/>

        <br/>
            
<p>Answer (B)<br/>
See <a href="http://geeksquiz.com/gate-gate-cs-2008-question-82/">http://geeksquiz.com/gate-gate-cs-2008-question-82/</a> for explanation.</p>
<p><br/><br/>
<strong>3) Which of the following is a correct attribute set for one of the tables for the correct answer to the above question?</strong><br/>
(A) {M1, M2, M3, P1}<br/>
(B) {M1, P1, N1, N2}<br/>
(C) {M1, P1, N1}<br/>
(D) {M1, P1}</p>
<p>Answer (A)<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
<strong>4) Consider the following relational schemes for a library database:<br/>
Book (Title, Author, Catalog_no, Publisher, Year, Price)<br/>
Collection (Title, Author, Catalog_no)</strong></p>
<p>with in the following functional dependencies:
</p>
<pre>I. Title Author --&gt; Catalog_no
II. Catalog_no --&gt; Title Author Publisher Year
III. Publisher Title Year --&gt; Price </pre>
<p></p>
<p>Assume {Author, Title} is the key for both schemes. Which of the following statements is true?<br/>
(A) Both Book and Collection are in BCNF<br/>
(B) Both Book and Collection are in 3NF only<br/>
(C) Book is in 2NF and Collection is in 3NF<br/>
(D) Both Book and Collection are in 2NF  only</p>
<p>Answer (C)<br/>
Table Collection is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form">BCNF </a>as there is only one functional dependency “Title Author –&gt; Catalog_no” and {Author, Title} is key for collection. Book is not in BCNF because Catalog_no is not a key and there is a functional dependency “Catalog_no –&gt; Title Author Publisher Year”. Book is not in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form">3NF</a> because non-prime attributes (Publisher Year) are transitively dependent on key [Title, Author]. Book is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_normal_form">2NF </a> because every non-prime attribute of the table is either dependent on the key [Title, Author], or on another non prime attribute.</p>
