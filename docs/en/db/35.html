			<p>For understanding equivalence of Functional Dependencies Sets (FD sets), basic idea about Attribute Closuresis given in&#160;<a href="http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/finding-attribute-closure-and-candidate-keys-using-functional-dependencies/">this </a>article<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gq/2015/12/fd1.png"><br/>

<p>Given a Relation with different FD sets for that relation, we have to find out whether one FD set is subset of other or both are equal.</p>
<p><strong>How to find relationship between two FD sets?</strong></p>
<p>Let FD1 and FD2 are two FD sets for a relation R.</p>
<ol>
<li>If all FDs of FD1 can be derived from FDs present in FD2, we can say that FD2 ⊃ FD1.</li>
<li>If all FDs of FD2 can be derived from FDs present in FD1, we can say that FD1 ⊃ FD2.</li>
<li>If 1 and 2 both are true, FD1=FD2.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these three cases can be shown using Venn diagram as:<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21873" src="../../../imgs/db/e23da9ec1c85e826932ce360eaf58de9.jpg" alt="fd1" width="584" height="168"/></p>

<p><strong>Q. Let us take an example to show the relationship between two FD sets. A relation R(A,B,C,D) having two FD sets FD1 = {A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, AB-&gt;D} and FD2 = {A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, A-&gt;C, A-&gt;D}</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong>&#160; Checking whether all FDs of FD1 are present in FD2</p>
<ul>
<li>A-&gt;B in set FD1 is present in set FD2.</li>
<li>B-&gt;C in set FD1 is also present in set FD2.</li>
<li>AB-&gt;D in present in set FD1 but not directly in FD2 but we will check whether we can derive it or not. For set FD2, (AB)<sup>+ </sup>= {A,B,C,D}. It means that AB can functionally determine A, B, C and D. So AB-&gt;D will also hold in set FD2.</li>
</ul>
<p>As all FDs in set FD1 also hold in set FD2, FD2 ⊃ FD1 is true.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong>&#160; Checking whether all FDs of FD2 are present in FD1</p>
<ul>
<li>A-&gt;B in set FD2 is present in set FD1.</li>
<li>B-&gt;C in set FD2 is also present in set FD1.</li>
<li>A-&gt;C is present in FD2 but not directly in FD1 but we will check whether we can derive it or not. For set FD1, (A)<sup>+ </sup>= {A,B,C,D}. It means that A can functionally determine A, B, C and D. SO A-&gt;C will also hold in set FD1.</li>
<li>A-&gt;D is present in FD2 but not directly in FD1 but we will check whether we can derive it or not. For set FD1, (A)<sup>+ </sup>= {A,B,C,D}. It means that A can functionally determine A, B, C and D. SO A-&gt;D will also hold in set FD1.</li>
</ul>
<p>As all FDs in set FD2 also hold in set FD1, FD1 ⊃ FD2 is true.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> As FD2 ⊃ FD1 and FD1 ⊃ FD2 both are true FD2 =FD1 is true. These two FD sets are semantically equivalent.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Let us take another example to show the relationship between two FD sets. A relation R2(A,B,C,D) having two FD sets FD1 = {A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C,A-&gt;C} and FD2 = {A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, A-&gt;D}</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong>&#160; Checking whether all FDs of FD1 are present in FD2</p>
<ul>
<li>A-&gt;B in set FD1 is present in set FD2.</li>
<li>B-&gt;C in set FD1 is also present in set FD2.</li>
<li>A-&gt;C is present in FD1 but not directly in FD2 but we will check whether we can derive it or not. For set FD2, (A)<sup>+ </sup>= {A,B,C,D}. It means that A can functionally determine A, B, C and D. SO A-&gt;C will also hold in set FD2.</li>
</ul>
<p>As all FDs in set FD1 also hold in set FD2, FD2 ⊃ FD1 is true.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong>&#160; Checking whether all FDs of FD2 are present in FD1</p>
<ul>
<li>A-&gt;B in set FD2 is present in set FD1.</li>
<li>B-&gt;C in set FD2 is also present in set FD1.</li>
<li>A-&gt;D is present in FD2 but not directly in FD1 but we will check whether we can derive it or not. For set FD1, (A)<sup>+ </sup>= {A,B,C}. It means that A can’t functionally determine D. SO A-&gt;D will not hold in FD1.</li>
</ul>
<p>As all FDs in set FD2 do not hold in set FD1, FD2 ⊄ FD1.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> In this case, FD2 ⊃ FD1 and FD2 ⊄ FD1, these two FD sets are not semantically equivalent.</p>
