			<p>We’ve been studying a lot about the Wired Network. Ethernet is the most common example. Wired networks differ from wireless which use radio waves rather than transmitting electrical signals over the cables.<br/>
Wi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity. It is a technology for wireless local area networking with devices based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11">IEEE 802.11</a> standards.<br/>
 Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the internet via WLAN network and a wireless <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point">access point</a></strong> abbreviated as AP. Every WLAN has an access point which is responsible for receiving and transmitting data from/to users.<br/>
IEEE has defined certain specifications for wireless LAN, called <strong>IEEE 802.11</strong> which covers physical and data link layers.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The architecture of this standard has 2 kinds of services:<br/>
<strong>1. BSS (Basic Service Set)<br/>
2. ESS (Extended Service Set)</strong><br/>
&#160;<br/>
<strong>BSS </strong>is the basic building block of WLAN. It is made of wireless mobile stations and an optional central base station called Access Point.<br/>
Stations can form a network without an AP and can agree to be a part of a BSS.<br/>
A BSS without an AP cannot send data to other BSSs and defines a standalone network. It is called <strong>Ad-hoc network</strong> or <strong>Independent BSS(IBSS).</strong><br/>
A BSS with AP is <strong>infrastructure network.</strong><br/>
The figure below depicts an IBSS, BSS with the blue coloured box depicting an AP.<br/>

<p><strong>ESS</strong> is made up of 2 or more BSSs with APs. BSSs are connected to the distribution system via their APs. Distribution system can be any IEEE LAN such as Ethernet.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
ESS has 2 kinds of stations: </p>
<p>1. Mobile – stations inside the BSS<br/>
2. Stationary – AP stations that are part of wired LAN.<br/>

The topmost green box represents the distribution system and the other 2 blue boxes represent the APs of 2 BSSs.</p>
