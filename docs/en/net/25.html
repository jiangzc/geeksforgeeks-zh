			<p>We take a close look at so called WiFi which is also known as  IEEE standard 802.11</p>

<p>Consider the situation depicted in figure, where each of four nodes is able to send and receive signals that reach just the nodes to its immediate left and right.<br/>
For example, B can exchange frames with A and C but it cannot reach D, while C can reach B and D but not A. (A and D’s reach is not shown in the figure.) Suppose both A and C want to communicate with B and so they each send it a frame. A and C are unaware of each other since their signals do not carry that far. These two frames collide with each other at B, but unlike an Ethernet, neither A nor C is aware of this collision. A and C are said to be hidden nodes with respect to each other.</p>
<p>A related problem, called the exposed node problem, occurs under the following circumstances. Suppose B is sending to A in Figure. Node C is aware of this communication because it hears B’s transmission. It would be a mistake for C to conclude that it cannot transmit to anyone just because it can hear B’s transmission.<br/>
For example, suppose C wants to transmit to node D. This is not a problem since C’s transmission to D will not interfere with A’s ability to receive from B.</p>
<p>We address these problems by a algorithm known as Multiple access with Collision  Avoidance (MACA). Sender and receiver exchange frames with each other before transmitting data.This informs all nearby nodes that a transmission is about to begin. Sender transmits <b>Request to Send (RTS)</b> frame to receiver .  The receiver then replies with <b>clear to send (CTS)</b> frame back to the sender. Any node that receives CTS frame knows that it is close to receiver therefore cannot transmit a frame. Any node that receives RTS frame but not the CTS frame knows that is not close to receiver to interfere with it, So it is free to transmit data.</p>
