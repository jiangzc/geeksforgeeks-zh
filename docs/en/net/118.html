			<p style="text-align: justify">Many folks consider that they both are same but are they really same?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>The Internet</em> is a global network of networks while <em>the Web</em>, also referred formally as World Wide Web (www) is collection of information which is accessed via <em>the Internet</em>. Another way to look at this difference is; <em>the Internet</em> is infrastructure while <em>the Web</em> is service on top of that infrastructure. Alternatively, <em>the Internet</em> can be viewed as a big book-store while <em>the Web</em> can be viewed as collection of books on that store. At a high level, we can even think of <em>the Internet</em> as hardware and <em>the Web</em> as software!</p>
