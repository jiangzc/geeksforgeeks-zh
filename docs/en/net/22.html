<td>In circuit switching there are 3 phases<br/>
i) Connection Establishment.<br/>
ii) Data Transfer.<br/>
iii) Connection Released.</td>
<td>In Packet switching directly data transfer takes place .</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In circuit switching, each data unit know the entire path address which is provided by the source</td>
<td>In Packet switching, each data unit just know the final destination address intermediate path is decided by the routers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In Circuit switching, data is processed at source system only</td>
<td>In Packet switching, data is processed at all intermediate node including source system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delay between data units in circuit switching is uniform.</td>
<td>Delay between data units in packet switching is not uniform.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Resource reservation is the feature of circuit switching because path is fixed for data transmission.</td>
<td>There is no resource reservation because bandwidth is shared among users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Circuit switching is more reliable.</td>
<td>Packet switching is less reliable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wastage of resources are more in Circuit Switching</td>
<td>Less wastage of resources as compared to Circuit Switching</td>
</tr>
