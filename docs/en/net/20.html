In circuit switching network resources (bandwidth) is divided into pieces and bit delay is constant during a connection. The dedicated path/circuit established between sender and receiver provides a guaranteed data rate. Data can be transmitted without any delays once the circuit is established.<br/>
Telephone system network is the one of example of Circuit switching. <b>TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) and FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing)</b> are two methods of multiplexing multiple signals into a single carrier.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Frequency Division Multiplexing :</b> <em>Divides into multiple bands</em><br/>
Frequency Division Multiplexing or FDM is used when multiple data signals are combined for simultaneous transmission via a shared communication medium.It is a technique by which the total bandwidth is divided into a series of non-overlapping frequency sub-bands,where each sub-band carry different signal. Practical use in radio spectrum &amp; optical fiber to share multiple independent signals.</li>
<li><b>Time Division Multiplexing :</b> <em>Divides into frames</em><br/>
Time-division multiplexing (TDM) is a method of transmitting and receiving independent signals over a common signal path by means of synchronized switches at each end of the transmission line. TDM is used for long-distance communication links and bears heavy data traffic loads from end user.<br/>
Time division multiplexing (TDM) is also known as a digital circuit switched.</li>
</ul>
<p>Formulas in Circuit Switching :</p>
<pre>Transmission rate = Link Rate or Bit rate / 
                    no. of slots = R/h bps
Transmission time = size of file / 
                    transmission rate 
                 = x / (R/h) = (x*h)/R second
Total time to send packet to destination =
               Transmission time + circuit setup time 
</pre>
<p><strong>Question on Circuit switching</strong> –<br/>
These questions will help you understand circuit switching</p>
<p>
<strong> Example 1 : </strong>How long it takes to send a file of ‘x bits’ from host A to host B over a circuit switched network that uses TDM with ‘h slots’ and have a bit rate of ‘R Mbps’, circuit establish time is k seconds.Find total time?</p>
<p><strong>Explanation :</strong><br/>
Transmission rate = Link Rate or Bit rate / no. of slots = R/h bps<br/>
Transmission time = size of file/ transmission rate = x / (R/h) = (x*h)/R</p>
<br/>

        <br/>
            
<p>Total time = transmission time + circuit setup time = (x*h)/R secs + k secs
</p>
<p>
<strong><br/>
Example 2 : </strong>If a link transmits F frames/sec and each slot has B bits then find the transmission rate?</p>
<p><strong>Explanation :</strong><br/>
Since it is not mention how many slots in each frame we take one frame has one slot.<br/>
Transmission rate is amount of data send in 1 second.<br/>
Transmission rate = F * B bits/sec
