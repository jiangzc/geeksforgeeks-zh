			<p><em>Prerequisite : <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-python/">Socket Programming in Python</a></em>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-python-set-1/">Multi-threading in Python</a></p>
<p><strong>Socket Programming</strong>-&gt; It helps us to connect a client to a server. Client is message sender and receiver and server is just a listener that works on data sent by client.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Thread?</strong><br/>
A thread is a light-weight process that does not require much memory overhead, they are cheaper than processes.</p>
<p><strong>What is Multi-threading Socket Programming?</strong><br/>
Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously in a single process.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-threading Modules : </strong><br/>
A <em>_thread module &amp; threading module</em> is used for multi-threading in python, these modules help in synchronization and provide a lock to a thread in use.</p>

<pre>from _thread import *
import threading
</pre>
<p>A lock object is created by-&gt;</p>
<pre>print_lock = threading.Lock()
</pre>
<p>A lock has two states, “locked” or “unlocked”. It has two basic methods acquire() and release(). When the state is unlocked <b>print_lock.acquire()</b> is used to change state to locked and <b>print_lock.release()</b> is used to change state to unlock.</p>
<p>The function <b>thread.start_new_thread()</b> is used to start a new thread and return its identifier. The first argument is the function to call and its second argument is a tuple containing the positional list of arguments.</p>
<p>Let’s study client-server multithreading socket programming by code-<br/>
<em>Note:-The code works with python3. </em></p>
