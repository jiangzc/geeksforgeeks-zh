			<p>A network is two or more devices connected through a link. A link is a communication pathway that transfer data from one device to another. Devices can be a computer, printer or any other device that is capable to send and receive data. For visualization purpose, imagine any link as a line drawn between two points.<br/>
For communication to occur, two devices must be connected in some way to the same link at the same time. There are two possible types of connections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Point-to-Point Connection</strong></li>
<li><strong>Multipoint Connection</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Point-to-Point Connection :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A point-to-point connection provides a dedicated link between two devices.</li>
<li>The entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission between those two devices.</li>
<li>Most point-to-point connections use a actual length of wire or cable to connect the two end, but other options  such as microwave or satellite links are also possible.</li>
<li>Point to point network topology is considered to be one of the easiest and most conventional network<br/>
     topologies.</li>
<li>It is also the simplest to establish and understand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: Point-to-Point connection between remote control and Television for changing the channels.</p>

<ol>
<li>It is also called Multidrop configuration. In this connection two or more devices share a single link.</li>
<li>More than two devices share the link that is the capacity of the channel is shared now. With shared capacity, there can be two possibilities in a Multipoint Line configuration:</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Spatial Sharing:</strong> If several devices can share the link simultaneously, its called Spatially shared                                  line configuration.<br/>
<strong>Temporal (Time) Sharing:</strong> If users must take turns using the link , then its called Temporally                                   shared or Time Shared Line configuration.</p>
