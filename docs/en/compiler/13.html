			<p><u><strong>Why FIRST?</strong></u><br/>
We saw the need of backtrack in the <a href="http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-design-introduction-to-syntax-analysis/">previous article</a> of on Introduction to Syntax Analysis, which is really a complex process to implement. There can be easier way to sort out this problem:<span id="more-142745"></span></p>
<p>If the compiler would have come to know in advance, that what is the “first character of the string produced when a production rule is applied”, and comparing it to the current character or token in the input string it sees, it can wisely take decision on which production rule to apply. </p>
<p>Let’s take the same grammar from the previous article:
</p>
<pre>S -&gt; cAd
A -&gt; bc|a 
And the input string is “cad”. </pre>
<p></p>
<p>Thus, in the example above, if it knew that after reading character ‘c’ in the input string and applying     S-&gt;cAd, next character in the input string is ‘a’, then it would have ignored the production rule A-&gt;bc (because ‘b’ is the first character of the string produced by this production rule, not ‘a’ ), and directly use the production rule A-&gt;a (<u>because ‘a’ is the first character of the string produced by this production rule, and is same as the current character of the input string which is also ‘a’</u>).<br/>
Hence it is validated that if the compiler/parser knows about <u>first character of the string that can be obtained by applying a production rule,</u> then it can wisely apply the correct production rule to get the correct syntax tree for the given input string.</p>
<p><u><strong>Why FOLLOW?</strong></u><br/>
The parser faces one more problem. Let us consider below grammar to understand this problem.
</p>
<pre> A -&gt; aBb
 B -&gt; c | ε
 And suppose the input string is “ab” to parse. </pre>
<p></p>
<p>As the first character in the input is a, the parser applies the rule A-&gt;aBb.
</p>
<pre>          A
        / |  \
      a   B   b</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Now the parser checks for the second character of the input string which is b, and the Non-Terminal to derive is B, but the parser can’t get any string derivable from B that contains b as first character.<br/>
But the Grammar does contain a production rule B -&gt; ε, if that is applied then B will vanish, and the parser gets the input “ab” , as shown below. But the parser can apply it only when it knows that the character that follows B is same as the current character in the input.  </p>
<p>In RHS of A -&gt; aBb, b follows Non-Terminal B, i.e. FOLLOW(B) = {b}, and the current input character read is also b. Hence the parser applies this rule. And it is able to get the string “ab” from the given grammar.</p>

        <br/>
            
<pre>           A                    A
        /  |  \              /    \                                                
      a    B    b    =&gt;     a      b       
           |
           ε </pre>
<p>So FOLLOW can make a Non-terminal to vanish out if needed to generate the string from the parse tree. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The conclusions is, we need to find FIRST and FOLLOW sets for a given grammar, so that the parser can properly apply the needed rule at the correct position.</p>
<p>In the next article, we will discus formal definitions of FIRST and FOLLOW, and some easy rules to compute these sets.</p>
