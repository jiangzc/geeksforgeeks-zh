			<p>As discussed in <a href="http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/toc-chomsky-hierarchy/">Chomsky Hierarchy</a>, Regular Languages are the most restricted types of languages and are accepted by finite automata.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<strong>Regular Expressions</strong><br/>
Regular Expressions are used to denote regular languages. An expression is regular if:</p>
<ul>
<li>ɸ is a regular expression for regular language ɸ.</li>
<li>ɛ is a regular expression for regular language {ɛ}.</li>
<li>If a&#160;∈ Σ (Σ represents the <a href="http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/toc-finite-automata-introduction/">input alphabet</a>), a is regular expression with language {a}.</li>
<li>If a and b are regular expression, a + b is also a regular expression with language {a,b}.</li>
<li>If a and b are regular expression, ab (concatenation of a and b) is also regular.</li>
<li>If a is regular expression, a* (0 or more times a) is also regular.</li>

<strong>Regular Grammar :</strong> A grammar is regular if it has rules of form A -&gt; a or A -&gt; aB or A -&gt; ɛ where ɛ is a special symbol called NULL.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<strong>Regular Languages :</strong> A language is regular if it can be expressed in terms of regular expression.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<strong>Closure Properties of Regular Languages</strong><br/>
<strong>Union :</strong> If L1 and If L2 are two regular languages, their union L1 ∪ L2 will also be regular. For example, L1 = {a<sup>n</sup> | n ≥ 0} and L2 = {b<sup>n</sup> | n ≥ 0}<br/>
L3 = L1 ∪ L2 = {a<sup>n</sup> ∪ b<sup>n</sup> | n ≥ 0} is also regular.<br/>
<strong>Intersection :</strong> If L1 and If L2 are two regular languages, their intersection L1 ∩ L2 will also be regular. For example,<br/>
L1= {a<sup>m</sup> b<sup>n</sup> | n ≥ 0 and m ≥ 0} and L2= {a<sup>m</sup> b<sup>n</sup> ∪ b<sup>n</sup> a<sup>m</sup> | n ≥ 0 and m ≥ 0}<br/>
L3 = L1 ∩ L2 = {a<sup>m</sup> b<sup>n</sup> | n ≥ 0 and m ≥ 0} is also regular.<br/>
<strong>Concatenation :</strong> If L1 and If L2 are two regular languages, their concatenation L1.L2 will also be regular. For example,<br/>
 L1 = {a<sup>n</sup> | n ≥ 0} and L2 = {b<sup>n</sup> | n ≥ 0}<br/>
L3 = L1.L2 = {a<sup>m</sup> . b<sup>n</sup> | m ≥ 0 and n ≥ 0} is also regular.<br/>
<strong>Kleene Closure :</strong> If L1 is a regular language, its Kleene closure L1* will also be regular. For example,<br/>
L1 = (a ∪ b)<br/>
L1* = (a ∪ b)*<br/>
<strong>Complement :</strong> If L(G) is regular language, its complement L’(G) will also be regular. Complement of a language can be found by subtracting strings which are in L(G) from all possible strings. For example,<br/>
L(G) = {a<sup>n</sup> | n &gt; 3}<br/>
L’(G) = {a<sup>n</sup> | n &lt;= 3}<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Note :</strong> Two regular expressions are equivalent if languages generated by them are same. For example, (a+b*)* and (a+b)* generate same language. Every string which is generated by (a+b*)* is also generated by (a+b)* and vice versa.</p>
<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">How to solve problems on regular expression and regular languages?</h3>
<p><strong>Question 1 :</strong> Which one of the following languages over the alphabet {0,1} is described by the regular expression?<br/>
(0+1)*0(0+1)*0(0+1)*<br/>
(A) The set of all strings containing the substring 00.<br/>
(B) The set of all strings containing at most two 0’s.<br/>
(C) The set of all strings containing at least two 0’s.<br/>
(D) The set of all strings that begin and end with either 0 or 1.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Solution :</strong> Option A says that it must have substring 00. But 10101 is also a part of language but it does not contain 00 as substring. So it is not correct option.<br/>
Option B says that it can have maximum two 0’s but 00000 is also a part of language. So it is not correct option.<br/>
Option C says that it must contain atleast two 0. In regular expression, two 0 are present. So this is correct option.<br/>
Option D says that it contains all strings that begin and end with either 0 or 1. But it can generate strings which start with 0 and end with 1 or vice versa as well. So it is not correct.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<strong>Question 2 :</strong> Which of the following languages is generated by given grammar?<br/>
S -&gt; aS | bS | ∊<br/>
(A) {a<sup>n</sup> b<sup>m</sup> | n,m ≥ 0}<br/>
(B) {w ∈ {a,b}* | w has equal number of a’s and b’s}<br/>
(C) {a<sup>n</sup> | n ≥ 0} ∪ {b<sup>n</sup> | n ≥ 0} ∪ {a<sup>n</sup> b<sup>n</sup> | n ≥ 0}<br/>
(D) {a,b}*</p>
<p><strong>Solution :</strong> Option (A) says that it will have 0 or more a followed by 0 or more b. But S -&gt; bS =&gt; baS =&gt; ba is also a part of language. So (A) is not correct.<br/>
Option (B) says that it will have equal no. of a’s and b’s. But But S -&gt; bS =&gt; b is also a part of language. So (B) is not correct.<br/>
Option (C) says either it will have 0 or more a’s or 0 or more b’s or a’s followed by b’s. But as shown in option (A), ba is also part of language. So (C) is not correct.<br/>
Option (D) says it can have any number of a’s and any numbers of b’s in any order. So (D) is correct.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<strong>Question 3 : </strong>The regular expression 0*(10*)* denotes the same set as<br/>
(A)  (1*0)*1*<br/>
(B)  0 + (0 + 10)*<br/>
(C)  (0 + 1)* 10(0 + 1)*<br/>
(D)  none of these<br/>
<strong><br/>
Solution :</strong> Two regular expressions are equivalent if languages generated by them are same.<br/>
Option (A) can generate 101 but 0*(10*)* cannot. So they are not equivalent.<br/>
Option (B) can generate 0100 but 0*(10*)* cannot. So they are not equivalent.<br/>
Option (C) will have 10 as substring but 0*(10*)* may or may not. So they are not equivalent.<br/>
